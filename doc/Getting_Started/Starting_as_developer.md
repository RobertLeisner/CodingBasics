# Learn basics of markup and markdown languages

The basic idea of markup and markdown languages is to transport structured text data containing text information and its intended formatting via a simple but over system borders transferable and usable plain text file.



There three major markup and markdown languages in use at the moment:

-   **Markdown** (markdown language): faster way to create formatted content then HTML for transfer to HTML, PDF, ...

-   **HTML** (Hypertext markup language): used to create webpages

-   **XML** (Extendable markup language): 

## Markdown language MarkDown

Markdown was develop based on the experiences made with HTML. HTML is still required for web development. But for tasks like writing code documentation HTML was felt to be to time consuming. So the basic idea of Markdown is to simplify the writing of it drasticallly compared to HTML but being able to generate HTML from it.

### Prerequisites

To create Markdown you can use:

-   a simple plain text editor like Notepad++

-   Visual Studio Code app (do not Visual Studio)

-

## Markup language HTML

HTML is used mainly for creating webpages. Nowadays HTML is normally always used in conjunction with CSS (Cascading stylesheets). HTML is defining the raw structure of the webpage, CSS is used to format it.

Writing HTML in a simple text editor is possible but time consuming. Using a WYSIWYG editor is recommended to speed up development.

A HTML file is normally an UTF-8 encoded plain text file with the extension .htm or .html containing only the ANSI subset of UTF-8.

For details regarding ANSI see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI.

### Prerequisites

To create HTML you can use

-   a simple plain text editor like Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code

-   a WYSIWIG HTML editor.


### Basics HTML

The following file index.htm is a sample for how to use of HTML without CSS:

``` html

```

### Formatting HTML with CSS

The following file index.htm is a sample for how to use of HTML with a separate CSS file:

``` html

```
And here the CSS file:

``` css

```
